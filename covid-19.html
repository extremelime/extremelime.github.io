<p class="">COVID-19 case numbers have increased in California despite action from state and municipal governments meant to slow the spread of the virus. New governmental policies often involve modifying the activity of economic participants in a way that attempts to reduce physical contact between people. There are challenges to the uniform implementation of social-distancing guidelines across industries that have led to varying approaches to handling these new policies. For example, while it is possible for universities to switch to an online-only format to limit COVID-19 exposure, the farm industry relies on physical labor that must be performed irrespective of whether workers are safe or healthy.</p><figure id="b9ce0f5d-45bc-48c0-9f6b-539edbdd67cd"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/08/california-covid-19-central-valley-essential-workers" class="bookmark source"><div class="bookmark-info"><div class="bookmark-text"><div class="bookmark-title">&#x27;Everyone tested positive&#x27;: Covid devastates farm workers</div><div class="bookmark-description"></div></div><div class="bookmark-href"><img src="https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico" class="icon bookmark-icon"/>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/08/california-covid-19-central-valley-essential-workers</div></div><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30e7d6f5d12e047f86eb591ffda5d676a0e18ca/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=bac2a1afe6e87962247972520ccb1d77" class="bookmark-image"/></a></figure><p id="6fe9e061-823a-476a-b27e-73579404717b" class="">There have been reports of some essential workers feeling unsafe in their working conditions. An assessment of risk across industries could inform policy makers, industry leaders, and members of the general public who may be employees or consumers of a specific industry, on whether additional precautions or guidelines may be necessary to conduct business in a safe and productive manner.

By analyzing economic data for the CA Employment Development Department and State of California COVID-19 Health Data (March 2020 - September 2020), we will seek to understand what effect (if any), county labor force distribution may have on COVID-19 case rates. More specifically we will seek to understand the effect that agricultural employment may have on COVID-19 case rates.</p><h2 id="Analysis"><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> Analysis</h2><figure id="c37147df-897e-4ade-9857-a10097211514" class="image"><a target="_blank" href="./covid/algorithm-flowchart.png"><img src="./covid/algorithm-flowchart.png"/></a></figure><p>The above chart depicts an overview of the data processing required for analysis.

The analysis objective was to derive insights from the monthly changes in COVID-19 cases and proportion of jobs both at the county and state level. This was achieved by examining if there were any significant correlations between monthly COVID-19 cases and monthly industry jobs (i.e. if COVID-19 cases may be lower or higher than average in a particular industry). All data were in the csv format and parsed into dataframes using the Pandas Python package, with the exception of the COVID-19 data which were parsed into a dataframe from an API. The data were then merged according to common county names and dates. Fourteen counties (California has 58) did not report data in 2020, so they were excluded from industry data calculations. This does not apply to unemployment data, however, which were reported for every county in the timeframe of interest.</p>
<h2 id="Visualization" ><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Visualization</h2><p>Line charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and choropleth maps were subsequently generated using the processed dataframes. All the line, bar, and scatter charts below were generated using <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">Plotly</a>. Choropleth maps were generated using <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium</a> and displayed in html using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. A few tweaks in Leaflet/HTML were required to calibrate the proper display bounds and zooming parameters.</p>

<p>We calculated industry proportions for the reporting counties using the industry job totals of each county (Figure 2, Left). Given these data, we wanted to test our hypothesis that COVID-19 cases would be higher in counties containing larger proportions of certain industries. To do this, we calculated COVID-19 weighted industry proportions. These proportions represent the percentage of total COVID-19 cases that can be accounted for by the industry employment proportion of each county. In essence, the key question is: if all COVID-19 cases could be evenly distributed across industry employment and employment status, given the varying industry employment proportions and COVID-19 case rates of counties, how many cases can be attributed to each industry or employment status? 

COVID-19 weighted proportions were calculated by taking the industry proportions of each county, multiplying them by the case numbers of each county, and then summing by industry before creating new proportions (Figure 2, Center). To highlight any changes between the two proportions, we calculated and plotted the difference of the two proportions (Figure 2, Right).</p>

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="./covid/3_change_proportion_industries_ca.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>Looking at the changes in covid-weighted industries, we noted that essential services (such as transportation and warehousing) stayed positive throughout this period, indicating potential increased contributions of new COVID-19 cases from counties that relied on such industries. In addition, some of the industries showed reduction in case contributions after weighting such as Professional/Business services, possibly due to the introduction of work from home arrangements. The largest increases in case contribution after weighting came from Total Farm and the unemployed. 

The data suggest that Total Farm began with low COVID-19 cases, and started to climb over the months, possibly due to the vulnerability of farm workers and lack of protective coverings (e.g. masks) as mentioned in the Guardian article. The data unexpectedly showed unemployment as a significant contributor to new COVID-19 cases. Unemployment increased as a consequence of lockdown measures imposed as a result of COVID-19, and unemployed people may have been more likely to make trips away from home as a result of having additional leisure time or as a result of searching for work outside the home.</p>

<p>We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of each county's COVID-19 case and laborforce statistics using the <a href=https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html>scipy.stats Python module</a>. After sorting by largest r values, we identified the categories with the strongest correlations to COVID-19 case rates, defined here to mean an r value greater than 0.5. Leisure & Hospitality had an r value greater than 0.5 for only one of the months in the period of interest and was not examined in further detail. It should be noted however, that the leisure and hospitality industry was the industry with the most job losses during the onset of the pandemic (<a href="https://www.ustravel.org/press/leisure-hospitality-accounts-whopping-39-jobs-lost-pandemic">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>). The sudden onset of travel restrictions and industry layoffs may be related to the initial moderate correlation and subsequent weak correlations calculated in this analysis. We visualized correlations below between the only two categories with moderate correlations across multiple months, Total Farm and Unemployed.</p>

<p>We identified a moderate correlation between Total Farm labor force and case rates in California counties from July to September. This is consistent with our null hypothesis and (anecdotally) consistent with the Guardian article linked in the introduction that reported on the agricultural sector's risk of COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>There is a moderate correlation between county unemployment and case rates from May to July. Causality may work both ways in this case, as higher case rates may cause more business closures leading to higher unemployment; or high unemployment leading to more job-seekers taking odd-jobs/gig-work that involve public interaction or leaving home for public assistance.</p>

More research can be done to determine if industry employment is of significance when taking other important demographics into consideration such as age, or the population density of an area.

Unemployment data from each county were obtained from the State of California Employment Development Department (<a target="_blank" href="http://edd.gov.ca/">edd.gov.ca</a>). These data contain the total number of unemployed in each county reported each month, since Jan 1990.
